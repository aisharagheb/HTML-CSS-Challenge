# Considerations

1. __Engagement:__
Is the participant engaged and asking a lot of questions? If not encourage them to talk out loud and explain their though process as they go. We are looking for insight into the way they are approaching the problem and trying to gauge their passion for HTML/CSS. 

2. __Efficiency:__
How much is the participant able to complete? How did their decisions about how to proceed affect their completion rate? How  familiar were they with their tools? What did they get hung up on? What might they have done differently to have finished more of the challenge?

3. __Code Quality:__
Was their HTML semantic and up to date? Was it formatted consistently? Did they have any difficulty with CSS implementation? How much did they have to look up? Was their CSS  formatted consistently, and well? Did the participant ask about browser support before diving in? 

4. __Architecture:__ 
Was the participant concerned with details that went above and beyond mere implementation? Was the CSS they wrote in any way modular or reusable? What was their approach to naming? Did they  attempt to establish any conventions?
